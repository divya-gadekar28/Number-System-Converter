# Number-System-Converter-in-C

This is a a small & simple desktop application made using C language for quick number conversion
Currently the conversions support :
-Decimal (base 10)
-Hexadecimal (base 16)
-Octal (base 8)
-Binary (base 2)
It consists of designing C programs to convert numbers from one number system
to another number system.

I know there are lots of tools available online for conversion between number system but I wanted to make a small and handy one for myself so came up with this.
